Scroll Studio is an website that allows users to generate short videos that can be posted to social media complete with script generation, image rendering, captioning and video generation!

Users do not even have to write the prompt! The website is integrated with Gemini API that generates the script based on the user's choice of story line and selected theme. 

The welcome page has a minimalistic design, allowing users to understand the features of the product at a first glance. It also features a 3d design element that will in later version have an AI voice assistant feature.
